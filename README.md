This code creates a database called studentmanagement and two tables in it: userdetail and studentdetails. The userdetail table stores the username and password of the users who can access the database. The studentdetails table stores the information of the students such as their student number, first name, last name, mobile number, course, and stream. The code also inserts some sample data into both tables for testing purposes
